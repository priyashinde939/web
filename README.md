# Portfolio website [live-version](https://zabiegli-development.pl/)

## Tech stack: React + TypeScript + Vite + Express

Website created in React/TypeScript with 3D background particle system animation, created in plain Three.js and GSAP. Particle system could turn into 3D music visualizer (customize animation button). Default music file was created by **Diephoanghai**, you could find his work [here](https://pixabay.com/pl/users/diephoanghai-12989642/). You can upload any file with \*.mp3 format play it and enjoy visualization.

There is added **unreal bloom pass** - post-processing effect of Three.js. Random movement of particles is created in thanks to webgl-noise [Perlin noise](https://github.com/stegu/webgl-noise). Particle color change is effect of experiments with **Fragment Shader**.
